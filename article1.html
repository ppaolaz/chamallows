<h1>Haribo history</h1>

    Haribo goes back to the early 1920, meaning that the brand has existed for more than a century. The name Haribo comes from it's founder, Hans Riegel Bonn. It was founded in Germany. The company created the first gummy candy in 1922 in the form of little gummy bears called Gummibärchen. Goldbears are fruit gums in the shape of stylised bears, that are two centimetres in size and consist of sugar, sugar syrup, colourants and flavourings. They also contain acidifiers, coating agents, water and a gelatine mixture, which gives the bears their rubbery consistency. 
</p>
<p>
    Since 1960, Haribo calls its gummy bears Goldbears, in order to distinguish them from other manufacturers' products. For the same reason, Haribo Chamallows are named Chamallows and not marshmallows. In 2005, Haribo produced about 100 million Goldbears daily in 15 establishments throughout Europe to ensure the distribution in over 100 countries. 
</p>
<p>
    Haribo entered the UK sweets market by buying Dunhill's in 1992, a manufacturer of licorice Pontefract cakes which was founded in the 18th century. Haribo's key brands in the UK are Starmix, Tangfastics, Supermix, and Maoam.
</p>
<p>
    Haribo had been imported into the United States for many years in bulk by German food importers and sold at German and other gourmet stores at a large markup. When Haribo of America was incorporated in the 1980s in Baltimore, Maryland, Haribo's gummi candies were introduced to the US mass market through retailers such as drugstores, grocery stores, and discount stores. Haribo plans to expand to China and Brazil. In China, it has launched test stores in Shanghai and in Guangdong province. 
</p>
<p>
    Haribo's German catchphrase is „Haribo macht Kinder froh – und Erwachsene ebenso" ("Haribo makes children happy – and adults as well"). The German advertisements were voiced by Thomas Gottschalk from 1991 until 2015. In English-speaking countries, it uses the slogan "Kids and grown-ups love it so – the happy world of Haribo".
